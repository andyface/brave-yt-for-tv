# brave-yt-for-tv
Brave scriptlet to make Youtube function a bit nicer when used with a TV. This script attempts to trigger fullscreen automatically (if browser security features allow it) when a video starts to play, returns to the home page at the end of the video and removes keyboard shortcuts that aren't super helpful.
